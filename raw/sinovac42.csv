"This is important globally because, due to western greed and selfishness, Sinovac remains the main vaccine being distributed to low-income countries. For example, 2/3 of all vaccines administered in Kenya were donated Sinovac shots. https://t.co/G4JaH3NkOt",en,2022-03-29 14:26:23
"Obviously this is a policy issue for HK and mainland China, which can be solved by using interventions to prevent COVID-19 importation and transmission while booster shots are distributed and vaccine uptake improved. But it’s not a sign that Sinovac doesn’t work.",en,2022-03-29 14:26:22
"This is why we see the huge drop in effectiveness for two doses relative to 1 or 3: because the two dose people are seeing waning immunity and haven’t got their third dose yet. This waning immunity is happening more in older, higher-risk people who took Sinovac early.",en,2022-03-29 14:26:21
"The second issue that is more pertinent to the low efficacy of two-dose Sinovac is timing. Sinovac was rolled out much earlier than BioNTech, which only took off from September. This figure shows the proportion of all people in two indicative age groups who received each vaccine. https://t.co/BpC6KwdnPf",en,2022-03-29 14:26:19
"We know that mortality risk increases significantly with age, as this slide from Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Protection shows. A different balance of age groups will give a different balance of mortality risks, and we should expect Sinovac to look worse than BioNTech. https://t.co/jO4NLZKFRm",en,2022-03-29 14:26:17
"First the risk profile. I obtained data on total vaccines administered by type in Hong Kong, by age. This slide shows the % of all double-vaxxed over-60s by 10-year age group, by vaccine type. Sinovac recipients were *much* more likely to be older. https://t.co/l2iH5auPGH",en,2022-03-29 14:26:15
"Let’s look at this slide in detail. 2-dose Sinovac gives 77% protection against death in over 60s, but 3-dose Sinovac gives 98% protection. This is weird, and it suggests that there’s more to this story than a weak vaccine: Risk profile and timing. Let’s look at these. https://t.co/6OuKlOc6v7",en,2022-03-29 14:26:13
"A recent presentation by Hong Kong University (HKU) professors has been used by the usual China “experts” and journalists to argue that reliance on China’s vaccine, Sinovac, compared to BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine was a bad idea, with tweets like this. https://t.co/w3FGfhf8ha",en,2022-03-29 14:26:12
